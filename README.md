This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to upgrade packages after updating the package list. Using `apt-get update` alone will only refresh the package list, not install the latest versions of the packages. This can lead to inconsistencies and issues if your application relies on specific package versions.  The `Dockerfile_fixed` shows the correct approach.
